# Enhanced Markdown Formatting for Chat Responses

## Overview
The chat interface now supports rich Markdown formatting for assistant responses, providing a more professional and readable experience.

## Supported Markdown Features

### 1. Text Formatting
- **Bold text**: Use `**text**` for emphasis on important terms or findings
- *Italic text*: Use `*text*` for document references or technical terms
- `Inline code`: Use backticks for technical terms or variables

### 2. Lists
#### Unordered Lists
Use `-` or `*` for bullet points:
```markdown
- First finding
- Second finding
- Third finding
```

#### Ordered Lists
Use numbers for sequential information:
```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

### 3. Blockquotes
Use `>` for highlighting important information or quotes:
```markdown
> This is an important statement or quote from a document
```

### 4. Headings
- `# Heading 1` - Main sections
- `## Heading 2` - Subsections
- `### Heading 3` - Minor sections

### 5. Code Blocks
Use triple backticks for code or data:
```markdown
```
Sample data or code here
```
```

## Example Response Format

Here's how a well-formatted response should look:

```markdown
I could not find sufficient information in the available articles to fully answer this question. However, I can provide the following relevant information based on the documents.

**Available Information:**

- **Bion-M 1 Mission**: Document 1 mentions that Russia resumed its biomedical research in space with the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, which had a 30-day flight (*April 19â€“May 19, 2013*).

- **Mouse Strains**: The mission used male *C57/BL6* mice for physiological studies, which is notable as most recent space experiments used female mice.

- **Research Objectives**: The aim was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity.

**Key Findings from Related Studies:**

1. **Physiological Effects**: Document 4 discusses that long-duration spaceflight creates stresses affecting skeletal and immune systems
2. **Sample Collection**: Document 3 highlights the importance of proper sample collection techniques in spaceflight experiments
3. **Simulated Microgravity**: Document 5 shows that simulated microgravity can lead to:
   - Decreased activity
   - Altered gait
   - Enhanced fear memory
   - Bone loss
   - Immune/endocrine changes

> However, specific details about the training and selection program for male C57/BL6 mice and how this program influences physiological adaptation are not provided in the available documents.
```

## Visual Design

### Assistant Message Styling
- White background with subtle border
- Comfortable padding (16px)
- Proper line height for readability
- Responsive max-width (80% of container)

### Markdown Element Styling
- **Bold text**: Font-weight 600, darker gray (#111827)
- *Italic text*: Slanted, medium gray (#374151)
- Lists: Proper indentation with disc/decimal markers
- Blockquotes: Blue left border with light blue background
- Code: Gray background (#F3F4F6) with monospace font

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Clear visual hierarchy with headings and formatting
2. **Better Organization**: Structured information with lists and sections
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern design matching scientific documentation
4. **Enhanced Comprehension**: Visual cues help users understand complex information
5. **Flexible Content**: Supports various types of scientific data presentation

## Technical Implementation

- **Library**: react-markdown v10.1.0 with remark-gfm for GitHub Flavored Markdown
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom prose classes
- **Rendering**: Client-side rendering in MessageBubble component
- **Performance**: Optimized with React memoization for large documents
